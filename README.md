My name is Neil Chavis, and I'm an aspiring SOC Analyst. I'm dedicated to mastering core blue team practices through hands-on, structured learning. This portfolio showcases my work across detection strategies, threat intelligence, log analysis, SIEM tools, and incident response workflows. My goal is to build real-world competency in detection and defense, and every project represents progress toward that mission.
