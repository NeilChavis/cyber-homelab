# cyber-homelab
My name is Neil Chavis, and I'm an aspiring SOC Analyst. I'm dedicated to mastering core blue team practices through hands-on, structured learning. This portfolio showcases my work across detection strategies, threat intelligence, log analysis, SIEM tools, and incident response workflows. My goal is to build real-world competency in detection and defense, and every project represents progress toward that mission.

## 🔧 Tools I’m Using
- **Nmap** – Network scanning, port discovery, and service enumeration
- **Wireshark** – Deep packet inspection and PCAP analysis
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework for testing detection and defense
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** – Log collection, search, and dashboarding
- **Zeek** – Network traffic monitoring and log generation for analysis
- **Suricata** – IDS/IPS engine for rule-based traffic detection
- **Sysmon** – Host-level event logging for Windows systems

## 📝 In Progress
- Setting up and configuring tools and VMs in homelab
- Completing THM SOC Level 1 (started Section 1)
