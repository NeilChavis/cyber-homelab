# cyber-homelab
My name is Neil Chavis, and I'm an aspiring SOC Analyst. I'm dedicated to mastering core blue team practices through hands-on, structured learning. This portfolio showcases my work across detection strategies, threat intelligence, log analysis, SIEM tools, and incident response workflows. My goal is to build real-world competency in detection and defense, and every project represents progress toward that mission.

## 🔧 Tools I’m Using
- **Nmap** – Network scanning, port discovery, and service enumeration
- **Wireshark** – Deep packet inspection and PCAP analysis
- **Metasploit** – Exploitation framework for testing detection and defense
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** – Log collection, search, and dashboarding
- **Zeek** – Network traffic monitoring and log generation for analysis
- **Suricata** – IDS/IPS engine for rule-based traffic detection
- **Sysmon** – Host-level event logging for Windows systems

## 📝 In Progress
- Setting up and configuring tools and VMs in homelab
- Completing THM SOC Level 1 (started Section 1)
- Planning projects and exercises for Blue Team concepts

## 🎯 Goals & Milestones
- ✅ Complete Google Cybersecurity Certificate
- ✅ Pass CompTIA Security+ (target: June 2025)
- ⏳ Complete TryHackMe SOC Level 1 pathway (target: Oct 2025)
- ⏳ Gain hands-on experience and proficiency with core tools
- ⏳ Setup and execute at least 5 capstone projects (target: Dec 2025)

## 🎯 Capstone Project Milestones
- [ ] **CP Lvl1 – IOC Enrichment & Log Review**  
  _Analyze Sysmon/Windows logs and enrich IOCs using VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and Shodan._

- [ ] **CP Lvl2 – Network Traffic Detection**  
  _Use Zeek and Wireshark to analyze PCAP data, detect suspicious activity, and map it to MITRE ATT&CK._

- [ ] **CP Lvl3 – SIEM Alert Simulation**  
  _Create detection logic using Suricata and analyze alerts in Splunk or ELK. Perform triage and write a basic report._

- [ ] **CP Lvl4 – Full Incident Response Simulation**  
  _Simulate a complete alert scenario from detection to documentation, including threat intel enrichment and escalation._

- [ ] **CP Lvl5 – Threat Hunting Engagement**  
  _Form a hypothesis using MITRE TTPs, hunt across logs using SIEM or ELK data, and document investigation results._
